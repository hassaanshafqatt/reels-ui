      # If you prefer docker-init.sh to source the env file directly, you can
      # mount a local env file as /app/.env (read-only). Example (uncomment to use):
      # - ./prod.env:/app/.env:ro
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
    # Provide runtime environment variables from a file. Create a `prod.env`
    # next to this compose file (do NOT commit it). docker-compose will load
    # the variables and inject them into the container's environment at runtime.
